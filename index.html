    <p>The console screen is a coder's best friend. It can be used to figure out any issues with the code and it will specifically tell what the issue is and in what line of code it is in. The console screen can be opened by right-clicking on the web page and clicking inspect. Then, you can choose console and see if there are any issues with the code. </p>
